// ----> How to write documents <------

/**
 This is your User documentation.
 A very long one.
 
 # Text
 It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)
 
 # Lists
 Sometimes you want numbered lists:

 1. One
 2. Two
 3. Three

 Sometimes you want bullet points:

 * Start a line with a star
 * Profit!

 Alternatively,

 - Dashes work just as well
 - And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:
   - Like this
   - And this
 
 # Code
 ```
 if (isAwesome){
   return true
 }
 ```
*/
//struct User {
//    let firstName: String
//    let lastName: String
//}
